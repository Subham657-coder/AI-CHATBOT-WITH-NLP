For Task 3 of my CodTech internship, I developed a beginner-friendly project titled “Basic AI Chatbot Using NLP in Python”. The goal of this task was to create a chatbot that could answer user queries using simple natural language processing (NLP) techniques. To build the chatbot, I used the Python programming language along with the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. This project focused on handling user input, breaking it down into understandable components, and responding based on matched keywords. The chatbot was designed to understand basic greetings, farewells, and simple questions like “what is your name” or “how are you.” This version did not rely on machine learning but rather used hard-coded rules and keyword matching, which made it perfect for grasping the fundamentals of NLP and chatbot design.

The chatbot worked by first accepting user input, then tokenizing the input using NLTK’s word_tokenize() function to split the sentence into words. These words were converted to lowercase and stripped of punctuation to normalize the text, making it easier to analyze. After preprocessing the input, the chatbot used conditional logic to check for the presence of certain keywords such as “hello,” “bye,” “thanks,” or “name.” Based on these checks, it selected an appropriate predefined response and printed it to the terminal. For example, if the user input contained “hello,” the bot would respond with a greeting like “Hello! How can I assist you today?” This approach, although simple, showed how even basic language processing could be used to make interactive and engaging programs.

By completing this task, I learned the core principles of NLP such as tokenization, text normalization, and keyword-based intent recognition. It helped me understand how chatbots work under the hood before machine learning or AI is introduced. Additionally, I became familiar with NLTK, one of the most widely used NLP libraries for Python. Although this chatbot was limited in functionality, it served as a strong foundation for more complex chatbot development. I also realized how basic rule-based systems, when combined with good preprocessing, can still deliver a user-friendly experience. Overall, this task was a great starting point in NLP and chatbot development and gave me the confidence to explore more intelligent systems in the future.
